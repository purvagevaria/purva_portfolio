# Your Name

Hey this is Purva Gevaria. I am an IT professional skilled in mobile app development (Android, React Native, Flutter). Transitioning from India, I'm pursuing data analytics at Durham College since May 2023. This shift reflects my commitment to adapting to industry trends, focusing on data's pivotal role in business decisions. Integrating my diverse development background, I aim to bridge technology and data for strategic insights in the dynamic tech landscape.
